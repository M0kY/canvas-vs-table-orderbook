# canvas-vs-table-orderbook

## Motivation

Sample implementation of an exchange orderbook developed with the intention of comparing components performance. On one side there is a standard implementation using tables, on the other an implementation using canvases. The main goal is comparing performance of these orderbook implementations in regard of the frequent content updates and necessary re-renders.
